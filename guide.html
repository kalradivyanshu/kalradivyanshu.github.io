                            You first need to convert your whatsapp chat into txt and mail it to yourself. Right now the app only works if the backup is generated with android device. Read how here: <a href = "https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/android/23756533">https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/android/23756533</a>. Then copy that chat, and paste it in the "Paste Chat here" box, and fill in the name you have on whatsapp (Find it in settings.) and then enter the contact name (as stored in your mobile) of the other person. Leave the Date Format on auto. If you feel like your analysis was wrong, then try changing the date setting.

                            You shouldnt, and you are not. The chat never leaves your browser. All the processing happens in the browser itself and the chat is never transfered to any server. The whole code is open source, you can see for yourself: <a href="https://github.com/kalradivyanshu/kalradivyanshu.github.io">https://github.com/kalradivyanshu/kalradivyanshu.github.io</a>. If you press on save and share button, only the analytics is send to the server and saved in a SQL database, i.e the chat isnt sent to the server, only the pie chart, and graph data (data like how many total messages were exchanged, the message content isnt stored.) is sent. If that bothers you, dont press the save and share button.
